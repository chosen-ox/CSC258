1. HashMap tests
   10 methods are tested with 12 assertions in 10 functions
2. Markov Chain
   There is one HashMap and one HashSet used in this MC implementation.
   1. HashMap is used to  between transitions. We map (T, T) to usize. The key (a, b) means a transition from a to b.
      The value counts the total number of appearances of such transitions.
   2. HashSet is used to store the sample space. That is all possible Ts according to the input.

   On training, the MC implementation first store all elements into the sample space. Then, for each consecutive pair (a, b) in the
   input sequence, it increases counter of transition (a, b)

   On predicting, it enumerates all possible transitions (x, i) where x is the input and i is all the elements in the sample space and find the transition
   with the highest count.
